## ðŸŽ’ Prep Work

1. Create a new public GitHub Gist (https://gist.github.com/)

3. Copy the `API token`

## ðŸ–¥ Project Setup

1. Fork this repo
2. Go to your fork's `Settings` > `Secrets` > `Actions` > `New repository secret`

## ðŸ¤« Environment Secrets

- **GH_TOKEN:** The GitHub token generated above.

  `https://gist.github.com/Jookie262/`**`5ab38d3a50636dd6e90b8fbabe6f5c36`**.

  (Alternatively this can be put directly in `.github/workflows/tetrio.yml` as it is public anyway.)
